FTDI driver requirements

Install FTDI on linux drivers using instructions at
https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX/Linux/ReadMe-linux.txt - 

Have to be built on linux machine and copied to appropriate location 
I used the examples sub folder code (from the .tar download) to test installio on linux, specifically the SetVIDPID folder (I've added as a Repo on github)

For the drivers to work with our devices  you have to set the VID and the PID in the calling code.
Also by default the in built VCP driver (ftdi_sio) will take control of the ftdi device making it invisible to the D2XX ftdi driver.  This can be fixed by adding a "udev" rules file which unloads the VCP driver based on our PID and VID  (file 80-ftdi-sio.rules contained in this folder needs to be placed in /etc/udev/rules.d/ on unix box).
